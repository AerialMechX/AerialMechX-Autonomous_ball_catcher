# Dual RealSense Camera Calibration Settings
# =========================================
# Edit ONLY the serial numbers and checkerboard parameters to match your setup.

# RealSense serial numbers (string, exactly as shown in RealSense Viewer)

realsense_serial_1: "213522253879"

# Color stream settings (must match what you actually use)
frame_width: 1280
frame_height: 720
fps: 30

# Number of frames to use
mono_calibration_frames: 40        # per camera, more is better
stereo_calibration_frames: 40      # number of stereo pairs

# How much to downscale display previews (1 = full size)
view_resize: 2                     # 2 means display at 1/2 size

# Seconds / iterations between auto captures (used as a frame counter)
cooldown: 30                       # frames between captures, adjust as you like

# Checkerboard parameters
# These are INNER corners count (not squares count!)
checkerboard_rows: 6               # number of inner corners along vertical
checkerboard_cols: 8               # number of inner corners along horizontal

# Physical size of one checker square in meters
# e.g. 0.03832 ≈ 38.32 mm if you want the same as your old 3.832 cm value.
